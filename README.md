# Inventor_API
This is a simple Windows Forms application demonstrating how to create a basic extruded feature in Autodesk Inventor using the Inventor API.

- **Extrude**: Creates a new part document in Inventor, adds a rectangle sketch, and extrudes it.

## Usage

1. Click the **Connect** button to start or connect to Autodesk Inventor.
2. Click the **Extrude** button to create a new part document, add a rectangle sketch, and extrude it.
